                            <p>Sushi is popular around the world, but that doesn't mean everyone understands what this

                                that raw fish - sashimi in Japanese - is the most popular ingredient in sushi. The term
                                sushi actually refers to foods that use a type of rice seasoned with vinegar and are
                                garnished with raw fish or vegetable. The sushi rolls (maki) that you may be imagining 
                                are just one of many types of sushi.
